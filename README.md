# PixiProj
This is a Project Created in PIXIJS, just to demonstrate my understanding of the technologies we plan on using for our Game for CSCE 490. 

So the steps to running my code is to first get all of the files. Which are given above. The purpose of this project was for me to get a practice of spawning in characters into the map, along with differnet items. This includes things like position, altering size so that they fit the screen properly. Also having characteristics based on the canvas/map. 

So first you need to collect all the files and put them into one directory. For me mine was in the main directory called Farmer. You should have a two folders called "images" and "node_modules". Along with the file "index.html", "package-local.json", "package.json", "pixi.js", and "styles.css"

The things I used for this project is Nodejs and PIXIJS. Node was used primarily because I had to host my own local server in order to test the html files and make sure everything was working properly. 

So all you need to do to run the code, is to open terminal, depending on what operating system you are using. 
So since I was using terminal, I had to cd to the main directory i was using. Which is the "Farmer" directory.

Then you run this line next in terminal, alter the "Farmer" in this line based off your name for the main directory. 
"/Users/kendrickdubose/Desktop/Farmer/node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server" 

When this code is ran, you will recieve a list of possible local servers that you can copy and paste into your browser.

For example: 
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://10.183.229.189:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

You would copy "http://10.183.229.189:8080" and paste it into search bar on your browser. Which will open the file in the browser of your choose and there you go. Complete.
